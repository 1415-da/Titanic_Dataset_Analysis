# Titanic_Dataset_Analysis
The Titanic dataset is used to explore the factors that influenced the survival of passengers during the ill-fated voyage. This project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the training of machine learning models to predict survival outcomes.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis can be found on Kaggle: [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). The dataset includes features such as:
- PassengerId
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp (number of siblings/spouses aboard)
- Parch (number of parents/children aboard)
- Ticket
- Fare
- Cabin
- Embarked (port of embarkation)

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/1415-da/Titanic_Dataset_Analysis.git
   cd Titanic_Dataset_Analysis
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook titanic_analysis.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, train models, and evaluate results.

## Results

The project includes various visualizations and model performance metrics to evaluate the predictions. The final output is a CSV file containing the predicted survival results for each passenger.
